# Switch Mode ðŸŒ™

### Estimated time required: ~ 30 minutes

### Objectives
        - Add dark-mode switching functionality to the existing dark-mode button
            . Use the existing dark-mode scss file by adding a dark-mode class to the root html element
        - When in dark-mode : 
            . The button should be "fasun"
            . The button icon color should be (#FFA500) You can use the color prop on the Icon component

### Hint
    - How we would use Dark mode on other potential routes/components in a bigger application. Would your solution work for this?
    - How we can apply a class to the html DOM element?
